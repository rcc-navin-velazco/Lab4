// Check whether determinant is negative or positive

// Read in three real numbers from the user
// call them a, b, and c.
// Decide whether the determinant is negative or positive
// You compute the determinant using the following
// formula:
//   det = b*b - 4*a*c
// if det is less than 0 output "The determinant is negative"
// else output The "determinant is positive"

// Implement a Basic Calculator

// . Ask the user to type an expression
//    in the following from 
//    a [+,-,*,/] b
// a and b are real numbers
// and the operation between them is 
// addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division

// For example, the following are valid inputs from the user
// 5 * 3
// 3 / 43
// 4 - 10
// 10 + 123

// Read in the input from the user and then
// output the operation they want to perform
// For example
// if the user types in 10 * 3, you should output 30
// if the user types in 3 - 4.2 you should output -1.2
